My name is **Taihua Shao**. I am a second-year PhD student at the *National University of Defense Technology (NUDT)*, Changsha, China, with a major on Information System.

<!-- <img src="shao.jpg" width="30%" height="30%"> -->

During the master's period, my research topic mainly focuses on *natural language processing (NLP)* and *information retrieval (IR)*. I have conducted research on *question-answering (QA)*, or more specifically, answer selection in QA. My recent research interest involves Job-Resume Matching.
